Astrapol is an NFT-based game with intense competition and fair sharing that can operate across multiple networks. The DAK NFT has important features that sustain the ecosystem, such as accessibility of in-game resources, sharing, and opportunities to earn additional income. Users compete both against the server and among themselves by creating various objects within the game. All our objects have 3 different rarity levels. Our mechanics will ensure that each rarity level can be valuable. With the DAK NFT, which enables users to earn more income and have more in-game opportunities, we plan to offer an economic infrastructure that is resistant to inflation.
